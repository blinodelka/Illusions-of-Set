# Adaptation Aftereffects as a Result of Bayesian Categorization

Code, data, and materials for https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2019/papers/0298/index.html

We propose a unified explanation of contrastive and assimilative adaptation aftereffects from the perspective of higher-level cognitive processes: rational category learning and categorical perception. We replicate (twice) previously reported assimilative and contrastive effects (Uznadze illusion in visual modality), propose a rational computational model of the process,and evaluate our model performance against the Bayesian logistic regression baseline. We conclude by discussing theoretical implications of our study and directions for further research.
